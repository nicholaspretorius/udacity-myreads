# MyReads Project

Student: Nicholas Pretorius
Node Version: 10.15.0

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Run e2e tests with `npm run cy` (Ctrl + C to quit)
* Start the development server with `npm start`

### Overview

* This version of 'MyReads' allows the user to add multiple books from the /search page at once (i.e. does not take user back home after every book - I felt this made it easier/more natural to add books). 
* Books are stored in localStorage and can be cleared out by clicking on the "X" button on bottom left. 
* If there are not any books in a particular shelf, then the shelf will not be shown.
